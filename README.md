> Make full‑stack development accessible to everyone — with AI collaboration that never lets you get lost.

## 🎯 What is MetaForge Pro?

MetaForge Pro is an AI collaboration framework designed to be anti‑chaos, anti‑loop, and anti‑getting‑lost. It brings structure, clarity, and quality gates to AI‑assisted development.

It fuses three pillars:

- WaveForge — transparent human‑AI collaboration and state tracking
- MetaGPT — multi‑agent roles and division of responsibility
- Context Engineering — context‑first execution methodology

### ✨ Key Features

- 🚀 30‑second bootstrap with a single command
- 🛡️ 4‑layer safeguards against confusion and loops
- 🎭 5 professional AI roles with enforced identity
- 🎪 MetaMaster coordinator to orchestrate rules and roles
- 🌟 Golden Path workflow (the one true path)
- 🔍 Transparent task/state tracking at all times
- 🆘 Smart rescue commands and exception handling
- 📦 Copy‑and‑run, cross‑platform friendly

## 🚀 Quick Start (30 seconds)

In Cursor, simply type:

```
🚀 Start MetaForge: I want to build [your product idea]
```

If you ever get lost, use:

```
❓ I'm lost — tell me my current status and the next step
```

## 🎭 Roles & Stages

- Product Concept Designer 👑 — define core concepts → `core-concepts.md`
- Version PRD Manager 📋 — write detailed PRD → `version-prd.md`
- Tech Architect 🏗️ — design stack & architecture → `tech-architecture.md`
- Full‑stack Engineer 💻🧪🚀 — build, test, deploy
- Project Coordinator 🎪🔍 — end‑to‑end orchestration and quality review

All roles are governed by the MetaMaster coordination engine with quality gates.

## 🌟 Golden Path (loop‑proof)

Mermaid diagrams and workflow rules live under `.cursor/` (see `GOLDEN_PATH.md`). The framework enforces identity, handoffs, and gates so you always know what’s next.

## 📁 Repository Structure (essential)

```
.cursor/          # rules, roles, workflows, templates
examples/         # runnable examples (todo/ecommerce/saas)
tools/            # project scripts (init/setup)
docs/             # getting started, best practices, troubleshooting
```

## ✅ Guarantees

- Never get lost — always see where you are and what’s next
- No infinite loops — detection + rescue options
- User control first — explicit confirmations to proceed
- Continuous rescue — universal help command available
