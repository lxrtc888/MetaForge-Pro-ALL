# FAQ

## What is MetaMaster?
A coordination engine (rules priority 1000) that arbitrates rules, coordinates role switches, and ensures workflow quality.

## How is this different from Copilot/Cursor?
It is a full framework (roles, rules, workflows, quality gates) rather than an autocomplete or single-agent helper.

## Can non-coders use it?
Yes. The framework emphasizes product-thinking inputs and structured outputs; AI handles technical execution.

## Is there telemetry?
No. The framework ships without telemetry by default.
