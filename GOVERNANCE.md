# Project Governance

## Roles
- Maintainers: own repository settings, releases, and roadmaps
  - Initial Maintainer: @lxrtc888
- Contributors: anyone submitting issues/PRs

## Decision Making
- Day-to-day: Maintainers by lazy consensus
- Significant changes: RFC/ADR reviewed publicly; require 2 LGTM from maintainers

## Release Management
- Semantic Versioning (SemVer)
- Monthly patch, quarterly minor, semi-annual major when needed

## Working Groups
- Docs: oversees docs/site
- Framework: `.cursor/` rules, workflows, templates
- Tooling: `tools/` and CI

## Conflict Resolution
1. Discuss in PR/issue
2. Escalate to maintainers
3. Final decision by release lead for the cycle
